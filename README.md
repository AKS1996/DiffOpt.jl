# DiffOpt.jl
Differentiating convex optimization program (`JuMP` or `MOI` models) w.r.t. program parameters.


## TODO
[] Example scripts/problems in MOI form - LPs, QPs
[] Obtaining dual using `Dualization.jl`
[] Solve primal, dual problem. Test the solution gap
[] Write complementary slackness conditions. refer/use `BilevelJuMP.jl`
[] Test the solution in complementarity constraints
